Description: A set of functions to declare labels and missing values, coupled with
    associated functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and various
    other summary measures. 
    Various base functions are rewritten to make use of the specific information
    about the missing values, most importantly to distinguish between empty and
    declared missing values.
    Many functions have a similar functionality with the corresponding functions
    from packages "haven" and "labelled". A lot of effort was spent to ensure as
    much compatibility as possible with these packages, with the intention to
    offer a complementary alternative for the objects of class "declared".
