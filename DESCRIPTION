Description: A set of functions to declare labels and missing values, coupled
    with associated functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and
    various other summary measures. 
    Some of the base functions have been rewritten to make use of the specific 
    information about the missing values, most importantly to distinguish
    between empty and declared missing values.
    Many functions have a similar functionality with the corresponding ones from
    packages "haven" and "labelled". The aim is to ensure as much compatibility
    as possible with these packages, while offering an alternative in the
    objects of class "declared".
