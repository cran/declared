\title{
Functions to Declare Missing Values
}

\description{
A set of functions to declare labels and missing values, coupled with
associated functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and various
other summary measures. 
Some of the base functions are rewritten to make use of the specific information
about the missing values, most importantly to distinguish between empty and
declared missing values.
Many functions have a similar functionality with the corresponding ones
from packages "haven" and "labelled". The aim is to ensure as much compatibility
as possible with these packages, while offering an alternative in the objects of
class "declared".
